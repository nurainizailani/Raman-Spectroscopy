# Raman-Spectroscopy
Transform raw raman spectroscopy data through pre-processing functions (including baseline correction and smoothing filters), anomaly detection (namely cosmic spike detection). Visualize pre-processed raman spectra and unsupervised clustering (PCA) to reveal insights from raman spectroscopy data.
